### About Me

I'm passionate about technology and creativity. My interests span across music, games, and light novels, and I also enjoy exploring with software development. 

### Currently Learning

I am on a journey to enhance my skills in:
- **Dart & Flutter**: Building cross-platform mobile applications with sleek UI/UX.
- **Python**: Diving into backend development, data analysis, and automation.
- **MySQL**: Managing databases efficiently to support robust applications.

### Projects

Here's a glimpse of what I've been working on:
